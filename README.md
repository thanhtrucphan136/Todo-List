## Todo List Web Application by Javascript, HTML, CSS and Webpack

## Live-Demo: https://thanhtrucphan136.github.io/Todo-List/

## Features:

- Save projects and tasks to Local Storage <br/>
- Add and Delete Tasks <br/>
- Add Projects <br/>
- Add Due Date for Tasks <br/>
- Check and Uncheck Tasks <br/>
- Group Tasks that due Today <br/>
- Group Tasks that due This Week <br/>

### Need to fix:

- Having duplicates tasks at Inbox when reloading <br/>
- User-created project will not have its tasks after reloading. The tasks are still saved on Local Storage and will display on Inbox, Today and/or This Week <br/>
- Removing tasks does not delete task from the todoList(?), only disappear and will be there after reloading <br/>
- Checked tasks are not removed from the list, only change color and will be the same after reloading <br/>
